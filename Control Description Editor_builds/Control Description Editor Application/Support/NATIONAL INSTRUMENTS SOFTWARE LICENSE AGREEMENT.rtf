\par Except as expressly authorized under this Section 2, floating, concurrent, or shared use is not permitted under 
\par this Agreement. The specific use rights granted to you are as follows and depend upon the type of license you 
\par have acquired: 
\par A. 
\par Named User/Computer Based License. If you have acquired a named user license, you must designate in 
\par writing (through the NI registration process) one (1) of your employees to serve as the named user for the 
\par license (the "Named User"). The SOFTWARE may be installed on up to three computers in a single 
\par workplace of the designated Named User. Only the designated Named User, however, may use or 
\par otherwise run the SOFTWARE, and the SOFTWARE may not be run concurrently (i.e., it may only be 
\par launched on one computer at a time). At your discretion, you may convert a named user license to a 
\par computer based license. If you have acquired a computer based license or converted a named user license 
\par to a computer based license pursuant to this Section 2.A., the SOFTWARE may only be installed and used 
\par on one (1) computer in your workplace. In the case of a named user license, if any of the computers on 
\par which the SOFTWARE may be installed is a laptop, notebook or similar portable computer, or, in the case of 
\par a computer based license, if the single computer is a laptop, notebook or similar portable computer, you may 
\par use the SOFTWARE on the portable computer while temporarily away from your workplace for the same 
\par purpose permitted by this Agreement as you normally use the SOFTWARE on the portable computer while 
\par in your workplace. While all of the SOFTWARE must be installed and used on the same computer under a 
\par computer based license, there is no limitation on the number of your employees that may access and use 
\par the SOFTWARE on such computer; provided, however, that the SOFTWARE may not be run concurrently 
\par (i.e., only one instance of the SOFTWARE can be launched on one computer at a time). Regardless of 
\par whether the SOFTWARE is used under a named user license or a computer based license, in no event may 
\par any of the SOFTWARE be installed or used on a network storage device. If you have a VLP License or 
\par Surviving VLP License and you want to convert named user licenses to computer based licenses, you must 
\par give written notice to NI so that NI can send you a new license file reflecting the revised number of licenses 
\par of each type; provided that no more than four (4) such conversions may occur per calendar year. You may 
\par transfer a named user license to another designated employee provided that no more than four (4) such 
\par transfers may occur per calendar year. You may change the designated computer for a computer based 
\par license to another computer within the applicable single workplace; provided that no more than four (4) such 
\par changes may occur per calendar year and further provided that, immediately following such change, none of 
\par the SOFTWARE remains installed on the previously designated computer. Once the named user license for 
\par a designated Named User has been transferred to another employee or third party contractor pursuant to 
\par Section 2.M. of this Agreement, such named user license must be reregistered with NI to designate the new 
\par Named User. Unless otherwise specified by NI in writing, deployment licenses you have acquired in 
\par connection with any of the SOFTWARE listed in, or otherwise identified pursuant to, Section 12.B. as being 
\par subject to the license verification or distribution authorization requirements stated therein (each such 
\par deployment license being referred to as a "Designated Deployment License"), are computer based licenses. 
\par B. 
\par Volume/VLP License. If you have acquired the right to use the SOFTWARE for multiple users under the 
\par Volume License Program ("VLP"), you shall install and use an Approved Volume License Manager with the 
\par most current license file provided to you by NI that controls end-user access to the SOFTWARE licensed 
\par under the VLP. During the VLP Term, you may distribute the master installation disk(s) containing the 
\par SOFTWARE for internal installation and use by your employees only on those computers located at the 
\par Site(s). In addition to being subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Section 2.I., your use of the 
\par SOFTWARE under the VLP shall at all times (during the VLP Term and thereafter) also be subject to all 
\par 
\par 
\par terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement regarding the specific type of VLP License you have 
\par acquired under the VLP. As part of the VLP, you must, for each individual VLP License, acquire and 
\par maintain during the term of the VLP the Software Services for the SOFTWARE identified in the applicable 
\par VLP Documentation and for which NI makes such Software Services available. 
\par 
\par C. 
\par Enterprise Program/EP License. In some cases NI makes available licenses and services for certain 
\par SOFTWARE to certain customers pursuant to an NI Enterprise Program ("EP"). In such cases NI, or an 
\par authorized NI affiliate, and the customer enter into NI Enterprise Program Documentation that, among other 
\par things, identifies the SOFTWARE items which are covered under the customer's EP; the types and 
\par maximum number of the customer\rquote s EP licenses for such SOFTWARE during the EP Term; the types and 
\par maximum number of any licenses which the customer will obtain on expiration of the EP Term, and the 
\par SOFTWARE to which such licenses will apply; any EP Pre-Existing Licenses to be converted to Term 
\par licenses under the customer\rquote s EP for the EP Term; the Software Services which the customer is purchasing, 
\par and NI is providing, under the customer's EP; and the training and certification service credits which the 
\par customer is purchasing, and NI is providing, under the customer\rquote s EP. NI is not obligated to enter into, or to 
\par authorize or cause any NI affiliate to enter into, EP Documentation with you or to make the EP or its benefits 
\par available you. If NI, or an authorized NI affiliate, and you have entered into EP Documentation, then the 
\par following provisions of this Section 2.C., and Section 2.J., apply, and use of the SOFTWARE is subject to 
\par the provisions of this Section 2.C. and the terms and conditions set forth in Section 2.J. You shall install and 
\par use an Approved Volume License Manager with the most current license file provided to you by NI that 
\par controls end-user access to the SOFTWARE licensed pursuant to the EP. During the EP Term, you may 
\par distribute the master installation disk(s) containing the SOFTWARE for internal installation and use by your 
\par employees only on those computers located at the EP Locations. SOFTWARE may be used under the EP: 
\par (a) solely in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement regarding the specific type 
\par of license applicable to such license type acquired under the EP, (b) solely at, and on computers located at, 
\par the EP Locations, and (c) solely during the EP Term. After the expiration of the EP Term, any and all 
\par subsequent use of the SOFTWARE which may be permitted under the EP for which the license Term had 
\par not previously terminated shall be as provided in Section 2.J. You acknowledge and agree that: (i) in no 
\par event may your use of the SOFTWARE (in the aggregate) under the EP exceed the maximum total number 
\par of licenses set forth in the EP Documentation and (ii) no software (including any copies of the SOFTWARE) 
\par other than the copies of the SOFTWARE expressly identified in the EP Documentation may be used by you 
\par under the EP. 
\par D. 
\par Concurrent Use License. If you have acquired a concurrent use license, you may install the SOFTWARE on 
\par any or all computers at the Sites for use by Authorized Users at the Sites; provided, however, in no event 
\par may the number of Authorized Users who are accessing and/or running any of the SOFTWARE at the same 
\par time (i.e., concurrent users) exceed the Maximum Number of Seats which you have purchased. You agree 
\par that you will also use an Approved Volume License Manager and the license file provided by NI that controls 
\par end-user access to the SOFTWARE to ensure compliance with the foregoing. Your concurrent use license 
\par will automatically terminate if the number of concurrent users of the SOFTWARE at any time exceeds the 
\par Maximum Number of Seats which you have purchased. As used herein, the term "Authorized Users" means 
\par your employees at the Sites who use the SOFTWARE; for purposes of this Section 2.D. the term "Sites" 
\par means and is limited to only the Site (as defined in Section 2.I.(5.)) to which NI initially delivered the 
\par SOFTWARE and all of your Sites (as defined in Section 2.I.(5.)) which are located within the same country 
\par as that Site; and the term "Maximum Number of Seats" means the number of seats you have acquired as 
\par designated in the applicable quote or other documents provided to you by NI. For purposes of the 
\par concurrent use license, all Sites (as defined in Section 2.I.(5.)) which are located in a member of the North 
\par American Free Trade Agreement or South America shall be considered located in the same country, all 
\par Sites (as defined in Section 2.I.(5.)) which are located in Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Africa or any 
\par member country of the European Union shall be considered located in the same country, and all Sites (as 
\par defined in Section 2.I.(5.)) which are located in Asia shall be considered located in the same country. 
\par E. 
\par Multiple Access License. If you have acquired a multiple access license to use NI-488.2 SOFTWARE for 
\par GPIB-ENET hardware products (individually or collectively, "Multiple Access Software"), your employees 
\par may install and use the NI-488.2 SOFTWARE on any number of computers or storage devices in your 
\par workplace solely for the purpose of accessing Ethernet to GPIB controllers. If any of such computers on 
\par which the SOFTWARE may be installed is a laptop, notebook or similar portable computer, you may use the 
\par SOFTWARE as permitted by this Section 2.E. on the portable computer while temporarily away from your 
\par workplace. 
\par 
\par 
\par F. 
\par Debug License. If you have acquired a debug license, you must have licensed the applicable SOFTWARE 
\par components (as identified below) under (i) a separate named user license, computer based license, or VLP 
\par License with NI, in which case your applicable employee(s) may now, under the debug license, install such 
\par SOFTWARE components on one (1) additional target production computer (for each debug license acquired) 
\par for debug purposes only or (ii) a concurrent use license, in which case you may install and use the 
\par SOFTWARE for debug purposes only, in accordance with the concurrent use restrictions set forth above. If 
\par you licensed the applicable SOFTWARE components under a license other than a concurrent use license, 
\par then each of the applicable components must be used on the same target production computer. Debug 
\par licenses may only be used for debug purposes. In no event may you use the components for developing 
\par new programs (e.g., test sequences/modules, virtual instruments (VIs), etc.). Further, if you acquire any 
\par Upgrade to the applicable SOFTWARE, your existing debug license cannot be used with such Upgrade. 
\par Rather, you must acquire a separate, "upgraded" debug license from NI for use with such Upgrade. If the 
\par SOFTWARE is NI TestStand, then the applicable components are (a) the NI TestStand runtime execution 
\par engine for executing your sequences and the complete NI TestStand sequence editor development 
\par environment; (b) one (1) copy of LabVIEW and the applicable software toolkits; (c) one (1) copy of 
\par LabWindows/CVI and the applicable software toolkits; and (d) one (1) copy of Measurement Studio and the 
\par applicable SOFTWARE toolkits. If the SOFTWARE is LabVIEW, then the applicable component is one (1) 
\par copy of LabVIEW and the applicable SOFTWARE toolkits. If the SOFTWARE is LabWindows/CVI, then the 
\par applicable component is one (1) copy of LabWindows/CVI and applicable SOFTWARE toolkits. If the 
\par SOFTWARE is NI SwitchExecutive, then the applicable component is one (1) copy of NI SwitchExecutive. If 
\par the SOFTWARE is Measurement Studio, then the applicable component is one (1) copy of Measurement 
\par Studio and the applicable SOFTWARE toolkits. If the SOFTWARE is any of the following software, or any 
\par other software designated by NI as being software with respect to which NI offers a debug license: LabVIEW 
\par Mobile Module, LabVIEW Touch Panel Module, LabVIEW Real-Time Module, LabWindows/CVI Real-Time 
\par Module, LabVIEW FPGA Module, LabVIEW Control Design and Simulation Module, Vision Development 
\par Module, LabVIEW Statechart Module, LabVIEW DSC Module, or LabVIEW DSP Module); ("Designated 
\par Software"), then the applicable component is one (1) copy of such Designated Software. 
\par G. 
\par Academic Licenses. 
\par (1.) Student Edition License. If the SOFTWARE is a student edition (including SOFTWARE acquired 
\par pursuant to a student install option license), you must (i) be a Student or an Instructor; (ii) have acquired 
\par a student edition license; (iii) only, if you are a Student, use the SOFTWARE for your personal 
\par education purposes and not for any other purpose, including research, professional, commercial, or 
\par industrial purposes; and (iv) only, if you are an Instructor, use the SOFTWARE for your preparation for 
\par classroom or lab coursework and not for any other purpose, including use in a classroom or lab, 
\par research, professional, commercial, or industrial purposes. The SOFTWARE may be installed on up to 
\par three computers. However, only you may use or otherwise run the SOFTWARE, and the SOFTWARE 
\par may not be run concurrently (i.e., it may only be launched on one computer at a time). In no event may 
\par any of the SOFTWARE be installed or used on a network storage device. You hereby understand and 
\par agree that your license will automatically expire upon the conclusion or termination of your enrollment in 
\par an Academic Institution (or, in the case of student install option licenses, upon the conclusion or 
\par termination of your enrollment at the Academic Institution from which you obtained such license) or 
\par should you stop being an Instructor unless otherwise expressly specified by NI or its affiliates in writing; 
\par upon any such expiration, you must promptly uninstall all copies of the SOFTWARE. As stated in 
\par Section 5 below (without limiting the generality thereof), academic licenses, including student edition 
\par licenses, may not be transferred. 
\par 
\par (2.) Primary and Secondary School License. If you have acquired a primary and secondary school license, 
\par you may use the SOFTWARE solely for educational purposes in your primary and secondary school. 
\par Primary and secondary schools are defined as levels K\endash 12 and International Standard Classification of 
\par Education (ISCED) levels 0\endash 3. You may install the SOFTWARE on no more than the number of your 
\par school's computers specified by NI in writing in the applicable quote or other offer documents. If any of 
\par the number of computers on which the SOFTWARE may be installed is a laptop, notebook or similar 
\par portable computer, you may use the SOFTWARE on the portable computer while temporarily away from 
\par your institution\rquote s classroom, lab, or other facilities for the same purpose permitted by this Agreement as 
\par you normally use the SOFTWARE on the portable computer while in such facilities. The foregoing rights 
\par apply to a single school or campus and do not extend to an entire school district. You may distribute 
\par Authorized Applications created with the SOFTWARE that is properly installed on computers located 
\par within your campus, school, or department as indicated in the applicable quote or other offer documents; 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par provided that (i) you comply with all the terms and conditions in this Agreement regarding distribution of 
\par Authorized Applications and (ii) such distribution, and subsequent use of such Authorized Applications, 
\par is only to other primary and secondary schools and for educational purposes only. The foregoing are 
\par your only distribution rights under a primary and secondary school license. Notwithstanding anything in 
\par this Agreement to the contrary, in no event may you distribute any applications (including code such as 
\par VIs and executables) created with the SOFTWARE other than as expressly permitted in this Agreement. 
\par Any use of the SOFTWARE under a primary and secondary school license by any person who is not a 
\par student or teacher at your primary or secondary school or any use for research, commercial, or 
\par industrial purposes is expressly prohibited. 
\par 
\par (3.) Academic Teaching License. If you have acquired an academic teaching license, you may use the 
\par SOFTWARE solely for instructional purposes in your department, college, or on a specific university 
\par campus, in each case, of an Academic Institution, depending on the option selected in the applicable 
\par purchase order submitted to NI. A use will be considered as one for "instructional purposes" only if such 
\par use meets either of the following criteria: (i) a common exam is given to Students at the end of a 
\par semester or other academic period and the exam relates (in whole or part) to the Students' use of the 
\par SOFTWARE or (ii) homework or similar projects requiring the use of the SOFTWARE are used for 
\par grading in lieu of an exam. You may install the SOFTWARE on no more than the number of your 
\par Academic Institution's computers (located within the applicable department, college, or specific 
\par university campus) specified by NI in writing in the applicable quote or other offer documents. If any of 
\par the number of computers on which the SOFTWARE may be installed is a laptop, notebook or similar 
\par portable computer, you may use the SOFTWARE on the portable computer while temporarily away from 
\par your institution\rquote s classroom, lab, or other facilities for the same purpose permitted by this Agreement as 
\par you normally use the SOFTWARE on the portable computer while in such facilities. You may distribute 
\par Authorized Applications created with the SOFTWARE, provided, however, that (i) you comply with all 
\par the terms and conditions in this Agreement regarding distribution of Authorized Applications and (ii) 
\par such distribution, and subsequent use of such Authorized Applications, is for academic purposes only. 
\par Except for the foregoing limited distribution right, in no event may you distribute any software 
\par deliverables created with the SOFTWARE under an academic teaching license without the prior written 
\par approval of NI. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any use of the SOFTWARE by any 
\par person who is not a Student or Instructor at your Academic Institution or any use for research, 
\par commercial, or industrial purposes under this Agreement is prohibited. 
\par 
\par (4.) Student Install Option. If you are an Academic Institution and have acquired student install option 
\par licenses, NI will deliver to you the master installation disks for the applicable Student Edition 
\par SOFTWARE. You may make the applicable Student Edition SOFTWARE available only to (i) no more 
\par than the number of Students specified by NI in writing in the applicable quote or other offer documents 
\par and (ii) Students that are currently enrolled at the applicable department, college, or specific university 
\par campus of your Academic Institution specified by NI in writing in the applicable quote or other offer 
\par documents. All use of the SOFTWARE under a student install option license shall be in accordance with 
\par the student edition license terms and conditions above. The applicable student install option license will 
\par automatically expire upon the conclusion or termination of the applicable Student's enrollment at your 
\par Academic Institution; upon any such expiration, the Student must promptly uninstall all copies of the 
\par SOFTWARE. As stated in Section 5 below (without limiting the generality thereof), academic licenses, 
\par including Student Install Option licenses, may not be transferred (including to other Students or to 
\par another Academic Institution). 
\par 
\par (5.) Academic Research Option. If you have acquired an academic research license, you may use the 
\par SOFTWARE solely for academic research, teaching, and educational purposes in your department, 
\par college, or on a specific university campus, in each case, of an Academic Institution, depending on the 
\par option selected in the applicable purchase order submitted to NI. You may install the SOFTWARE on no 
\par more than the number of your computers specified by NI in writing in the applicable quote or other offer 
\par documents. If any of the number of computers on which the SOFTWARE may be installed is a laptop, 
\par notebook or similar portable computer, you may use the SOFTWARE on the portable computer while 
\par temporarily away from your institution\rquote s classroom, lab, or other facilities for the same purpose 
\par permitted by this Agreement as you normally use the SOFTWARE on the portable computer while in 
\par such facilities. You may distribute Authorized Applications created with the SOFTWARE; provided, 
\par however, that (i) you comply with all the terms and conditions in this Agreement regarding distribution of 
\par Authorized Applications; and (ii) such distribution and subsequent use is for academic purposes only. 
\par Except for the foregoing limited distribution right, in no event may you distribute any software 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par deliverables created with the SOFTWARE under an academic research license without the prior written 
\par approval of NI. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any use of the SOFTWARE for 
\par commercial or industrial purposes under this Agreement is prohibited. You must purchase Software 
\par Service for the SOFTWARE to maintain the license. 
\par 
\par H. 
\par Evaluation License; Pre-Release Software. If you have acquired an evaluation license, you may install and 
\par permit your employees to use the SOFTWARE on computers in your workplace for internal evaluation 
\par purposes only. If the computers are laptop, notebook or similar portable computers, you may use the 
\par SOFTWARE on the portable computers while temporarily away from your workplace for internal evaluation 
\par purposes only in the same manner as you would normally do so on the portable computers while in your 
\par workplace. You will be deemed to have an evaluation license for all SOFTWARE that has been provided to 
\par you by NI and for which you do not have a written document from NI expressly designating the type of 
\par license granted to you for the SOFTWARE. The evaluation license is for your own internal use only. 
\par Therefore, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, you may not distribute or transfer any 
\par applications you create with the SOFTWARE under an evaluation license. You also agree to use reasonable 
\par efforts to provide feedback to NI regarding your use of the SOFTWARE, including promptly reporting to NI 
\par errors or bugs that you might find. Any such feedback you disclose to NI, including any changes or 
\par suggested changes to NI's current or future products and services (collectively "Feedback"), shall be 
\par received and treated by NI on a non-confidential and unrestricted basis, notwithstanding any restrictive or 
\par proprietary legends to the contrary accompanying or otherwise associated with the Feedback. You hereby 
\par grant to NI a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, and irrevocable license to use, copy, and 
\par modify Feedback for any purpose, including incorporation or implementation of such Feedback into NI 
\par products or services, and to display, market, sublicense and distribute Feedback as incorporated or 
\par embedded in any product or service distributed or offered by NI. You also acknowledge and agree that the 
\par SOFTWARE IS EVALUATION ONLY AND/OR PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE. AS SUCH, THE 
\par SOFTWARE MAY NOT BE FULLY FUNCTIONAL AND YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE 
\par RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE. NI WILL NOT UPDATE THE SOFTWARE, NOR 
\par WILL NI SUPPORT THE SOFTWARE. THE SOFTWARE MAY CONTAIN CODE THAT WILL, AFTER A 
\par CERTAIN TIME PERIOD, DEACTIVATE THE SOFTWARE AND RENDER THE SOFTWARE UNUSABLE. 
\par ALTHOUGH THE SOFTWARE MAY WARN YOU OF THE TIME-FRAME IN WHICH IT WILL BE 
\par DISABLED, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE SOFTWARE MAY BE DEACTIVATED OR 
\par RENDERED UNUSABLE WITH OR WITHOUT WARNING. Upon such deactivation, this Agreement will be 
\par considered terminated. Prior to deactivation of the SOFTWARE, you may contact NI to convert your 
\par evaluation license for the SOFTWARE to a named user license or computer based license, under such 
\par terms, and to the extent, if any, that NI generally makes such licenses available for the SOFTWARE, or such 
\par other license as NI may (in its sole discretion) permit by paying to NI the applicable license fee and obtaining 
\par from NI the applicable authorization code(s). NI may (in its sole discretion and upon notice to you) terminate 
\par the evaluation license at any time, whereupon this Agreement will be considered terminated. If the 
\par SOFTWARE consists of pre-release SOFTWARE and is also covered by an alpha/beta license (the "Beta 
\par Agreement") between you and NI, the terms and conditions of the Beta Agreement, which are incorporated 
\par herein by reference, shall also apply to your use of the SOFTWARE. In the event of a conflict between this 
\par Agreement and the Beta Agreement, the terms of the Beta Agreement shall control. 
\par 
\par I. 
\par VLP Notes. The following applies to the VLP (Volume License Program): 
\par (1.) Program Requirements. You shall designate a separate Software Administrator for each Site and shall 
\par promptly notify NI in writing of any changes to the Software Administrator(s). In order to participate in 
\par the VLP, the VLP Licenses that you maintain during the VLP Term must at all times include a minimum 
\par of five (5) copies (in the aggregate) of a version of the SOFTWARE which is considered by NI to be a 
\par development version of a single NI SOFTWARE product. NI will deliver the master installation disks for 
\par the SOFTWARE and, if provided for in the applicable written quotation from NI, make available the NI 
\par VLM to the Software Administrator(s). You are responsible for ensuring that an Approved Volume 
\par License Manager, together with the most current license file provided by NI that controls end-user 
\par access to the SOFTWARE, (to the extent NI has made the SOFTWARE compatible with an Approved 
\par Volume License Manager) is in use at all times with the SOFTWARE licensed under the VLP (during 
\par the term of the VLP and thereafter). If the Approved Volume License Manager is the NI VLM or if NI 
\par makes documentation available for the applicable Approved Volume License Manager, such Approved 
\par Volume License Manager shall be installed and used in accordance with the documentation provided by 
\par NI. If you have existing individual, computer based or named user licenses for the SOFTWARE that are 
\par to be covered by the VLP, (i) you shall notify NI in writing of the product, platform, and serial number 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par information for each such license; (ii) each such license shall (as of the VLP Effective Date) no longer 
\par be in effect and shall be superseded by the VLP; (iii) all individual serial numbers for each such license 
\par shall be cancelled and replaced by a single, common serial number assigned to the VLP and the 
\par corresponding VLP Licenses; and (iv) should you later desire to obtain individual serial numbers for any 
\par of the VLP Licenses, you will be required to pay NI its then current fee for a conversion from a VLP 
\par License to an individual named user license, computer based license, debug license or Measurement 
\par Studio compile-only license having an individual serial number. Regarding Software Service, NI 
\par reserves the right to restrict Software Service to the then most current version of the SOFTWARE that is 
\par commercially available. You understand that NI may not make available Software Service for all 
\par SOFTWARE available under the VLP. 
\par 
\par (2.) Activity Compliance Logs. In addition to the submission requirement in sub-section (4.) below, you are 
\par required to provide an Activity Compliance Log for each Site to NI promptly (but in no event later than 
\par fifteen (15) days) following (i) the annual anniversary of the VLP Effective Date during the VLP Term 
\par and (ii) the VLP Termination Date. NI may, upon notice to you, inspect the Site(s) and applicable 
\par records in order to verify the accuracy of the Activity Compliance Logs. You shall pay any verified 
\par underpayments to NI within thirty (30) days of receipt of a written notice of such underpayments. Further, 
\par if you have underpaid, NI may require you to pay for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs actually 
\par incurred by NI in verifying the underpayment. 
\par 
\par (3.) Purchase Orders; Invoices. You shall submit purchase orders to NI as follows: 
\par 
\par a. 
\par in the amount of the Activation Fee within the time-frame specified in the quote provided by NI to 
\par you for the VLP; 
\par b. 
\par in the amount of the Additional VLP Fees prior to the end of the then current VLP Term as set forth 
\par below; and 
\par c. 
\par in the amount of the VLP Renewal Fees prior to the end of the then current VLP Term as set forth 
\par below if you desire to renew the VLP. 
\par You are required to obtain and maintain Software Services for each VLP License for which Software 
\par Services are made available by NI. The Software Services are charged on an annual basis and, for VLP 
\par Licenses added during the VLP Term, will only be pro-rated on a quarterly basis (based on the quarter 
\par of the VLP Term in which the SOFTWARE under such VLP License was first used), or such shorter 
\par basis as NI may designate, if a purchase order is submitted to NI prior to the date the SOFTWARE for 
\par the Additional VLP License is installed or otherwise used. All invoices shall be paid within thirty (30) 
\par days of the date you receive them. 
\par 
\par (4.) VLP Term. The initial term of the VLP will start on the VLP Effective Date and continue for a period of 
\par one (1) year (the "Initial VLP Term"). You may renew the VLP for additional one (1) year periods (the 
\par Initial VLP Term and each such renewal term, each herein referred to herein as a "VLP Term"). Should 
\par you desire to renew the VLP for an additional one (1) year period, you must provide a current Activity 
\par Compliance Log to NI at least sixty (60) days before the end of the then current VLP Term so that the 
\par number of VLP Licenses for the SOFTWARE may be determined. NI will then provide you with a quote 
\par for Software Services, any Additional VLP Fees that are applicable, and any new VLP Licenses that you 
\par request for the renewal VLP Term (the "VLP Renewal Fee"). The VLP will be renewed for an additional 
\par one (1) year period each time you issue to NI a purchase order for the VLP Renewal Fees prior to the 
\par end of the then current VLP Term. You shall promptly notify NI if the information in the Activity 
\par Compliance Log regarding the number of VLP Licenses changes following your submission, and NI 
\par reserves the right to revise the VLP Renewal Fee (as applicable) to reflect Additional VLP Licenses 
\par used and not reflected in the applicable Activity Compliance Log that you provided to NI at the time you 
\par desired to renew. IF, PRIOR TO THE END OF THE THEN CURRENT VLP TERM, YOU DO NOT 
\par ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER FOR THE SOFTWARE SERVICES AND ANY ADDITIONAL VLP 
\par FEES THAT ARE DUE (I) THE VLP WILL AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATE AT THE END OF THE 
\par CURRENT VLP TERM; (II) ALL SOFTWARE SERVICES FOR THE VLP WILL AUTOMATICALLY 
\par AND IMMEDIATELY TERMINATE AT THE END OF THE THEN CURRENT VLP TERM; AND (III) 
\par YOU MAY NOT, IN ANY EVENT, EXCEED THE NUMBER OF VLP LICENSES FOR WHICH YOU 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par HAVE PAID THE REQUIRED FEES TO NI. UPON TERMINATION OF THE VLP, NI WILL ATTEMPT 
\par TO PROVIDE YOU WITH AN UPDATED LICENSE FILE AND YOU MAY CONTINUE TO USE THE 
\par VLP LICENSES IN EFFECT (AND FOR WHICH YOU HAVE PAID THE REQUIRED FEES TO NI) 
\par PRIOR TO THE DATE OF TERMINATION (THE "SURVIVING VLP LICENSES"); PROVIDED THAT 
\par ALL SUCH USE IS CONDUCTED WITH AN APPROVED VOLUME LICENSE MANAGER (USING 
\par THE LICENSE FILE PROVIDED BY NI FOLLOWING THE TERMINATION OF THE VLP) AND IS 
\par CONDUCTED PURSUANT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING

\par EP Notes. The following applies to the EP (Enterprise Program): 
\par (1.) EP Services. The specific services that NI will provide to you under the EP are designated in the EP 
\par Documentation, and may include Software Services and Training & Certification Services as described 
\par below. With respect to the specific services listed below, the following shall apply: 
\par 
\par a. 
\par Training & Certification Services. If the services to be provided under your EP include Training & 
\par Certification Services, you may use available Training Credits during the EP Term as you desire for 
\par your employees to attend applicable training classes regarding the use of the SOFTWARE and/or 
\par to receive applicable "certification preparation" courses and certification testing services from NI. 
\par Available training classes may, unless otherwise noted, be attended on-line, attended at the 
\par corporate training facilities of NI, or may be conducted on-site at the Training Location(s) identified 
\par in your EP Documentation. Unless expressly agreed to in writing by NI, however, training classes 
\par may not be attended under the EP at training centers operated by third parties, even if such third 
\par parties are approved by NI to provide training. Although NI may provide a training schedule which 
\par lists applicable training classes that are available as of the EP Effective Date, the training schedule 
\par is subject to change at any time without notice to reflect changes in available dates and to include 
\par new classes or to remove or modify previously listed classes; provided, however, that the number 
\par of Training Credits required to attend an available course shall not change during the EP Term. 
\par Attendance at on-line training classes is subject to availability of applicable on-line seats. Training 
\par classes to be conducted at the Training Location(s) or at the corporate training facilities of NI are 
\par subject to availability of instructors and must be scheduled at least thirty (30) days in advance. 
\par There shall be no charge to you for applicable travel, lodging, and meal expenses associated with 
\par NI instructors providing on-site training services under the EP at the Training Location(s); provided, 
\par however, that, should you cancel a scheduled on-site training class, NI may invoice you for the 
\par actual cost of any non-refundable travel-related expenses that NI must incur with respect to such 
\par cancellation. Training Credits have no cash value and any unused Training Credits shall expire 
\par upon termination or expiration of your EP Term. 
\par b. 
\par Software Service. You shall designate a Software Administrator and shall promptly notify NI in 
\par writing of any changes to the Software Administrator. If the services to be provided under the EP 
\par include Software Services, then, instead of any obligation with respect to the delivery of copies of 
\par Upgrades under a VLP, NI shall provide: (i) your Software Administrator a master copy of all 
\par Upgrades after the applicable commercial release date and (ii) the number of your users 
\par designated in the EP Documentation with access to NI's application engineers for issues involving 
\par the installation and use of the SOFTWARE ("Phone Support"), and with access to NI\rquote s customer 
\par on-line technical support system ("Web Support"), all in accordance with NI\rquote s then current standard 
\par software maintenance and support policies. If the Support Services to be provided under the EP 
\par 
\par 
\par include Premier Software Support Services, NI shall provide access to the Premier Software 
\par Support Services to the number of your employees designated in the EP Documentation. NI 
\par reserves the right to restrict Software Service to the then most current version of the SOFTWARE 
\par that is commercially available. You understand that NI may not make available Software Service for 
\par all SOFTWARE available under the EP. 
\par 
\par c. 
\par No Hardware or Hardware Services. You acknowledge and agree that no hardware or 
\par hardware-related services are being provided or otherwise made available by NI under the EP or 
\par this Agreement. 
\par (2.) Annual Management Review; Reports. 
\par 
\par a. 
\par Upon such periodic basis as set forth in the EP Documentation (but at least annually), your 
\par representatives shall meet with NI\rquote s representatives to discuss the EP and your use of the EP, 
\par including, but not limited to, evaluating usage of the NI Software and Training Credits under the EP 
\par and determining the adequacy of licensing levels and number of EP Location(s) under the EP. 
\par b. 
\par You are responsible for ensuring that an Approved Volume License Manager, together with the 
\par most current license file provided by NI that controls end-user access to the SOFTWARE, (to the 
\par extent NI has made the SOFTWARE compatible with an Approved Volume License Manager) is in 
\par use at all times with the SOFTWARE licensed pursuant to the EP (during the EP Term and 
\par thereafter). If the Approved Volume License Manager is the NI VLM or if NI makes documentation 
\par available for the applicable Approved Volume License Manager, such Approved Volume License 
\par Manager shall be installed and used in accordance with the documentation provided by NI. Thirty 
\par (30) days prior to the meeting referenced in sub-section (2.) a. above or upon such other 
\par reasonable basis as NI may request, you shall provide NI with: (a) Activity Compliance Logs for 
\par each of the EP Locations and (b) a Usage Log for the SOFTWARE at the EP Location(s) with such 
\par Usage Log being generated by the applicable Approved Volume License Manager. NI may, upon 
\par notice to you, inspect the Site(s) and applicable records in order to verify the accuracy of the 
\par Activity Compliance Logs and the Usage Logs. 
\par (3.) EP Term. 
\par 
\par a. 
\par The "EP Term" shall have the meaning set forth below. Either NI or you may (in its discretion) 
\par terminate the EP Term upon written notice to the other party, if such other party is in material 
\par breach of any of its obligations under Section 2.C. or this 2.J., and has not cured such breach to 
\par the reasonable satisfaction of the non-breaching party within thirty (30) days of receiving written 
\par notice of such material breach from the non-breaching party. Further, should this Agreement, or 
\par any of the licenses granted by NI under this Agreement, terminate because of your failure to 
\par comply with any of the other terms of this Agreement, NI may terminate the EP Term upon 
\par providing you with written notice of such termination. Unless mutually agreed to in writing by you 
\par and NI, the EP Term shall not renew following the expiration of the EP Term. 
\par b. 
\par Effect of EP Term Expiration or Termination. Upon expiration or termination of the EP Term: 
\par (i) 
\par all use of the SOFTWARE under the EP shall immediately stop and you must destroy all 
\par copies of the SOFTWARE, provided however that you must deliver the SOFTWARE and all 
\par copies to NI if NI has so demanded prior to such destruction; provided, however, that 
\par (1) 
\par with respect to the EP Pre-Existing SOFTWARE, unless the EP Term is terminated by NI 
\par based on other than an EP-Only Breach, you may continue to use copies of such EP 
\par Pre-Existing SOFTWARE as may be designated in the EP Documentation for post-EP 
\par Term use, but any such post-EP Term use is permitted solely at the EP Locations and 
\par pursuant to, and solely in accordance with, the terms and conditions set forth in this 
\par Agreement regarding the specific type of license designated for such EP Pre-Existing 
\par SOFTWARE in the EP Documentation, applicable to such license type acquired under the 
\par 
\par 
\par VLP, and 
\par 
\par (2) 
\par with respect to any copies of the EP Pre-Existing Software which are designated in the EP 
\par Documentation for post-EP Term use which were either the most current version or the 
\par immediately prior version of the SOFTWARE as of the EP Effective Date, provided that 
\par the EP Term was not terminated by NI, you may elect to upgrade such copies to the 
\par current version of the applicable SOFTWARE as of the effective date of termination or 
\par expiration of the EP Term for use by you solely in accordance with sub-section (3.)b.(i)(1) 
\par above, 
\par but any and all rights under sub-sections (3.)b.(i)(1) and (2) above shall not apply to 
\par copies of any SOFTWARE the license for which terminated during, or upon termination of, 
\par the EP Term as a result of your failure to comply with the terms of this Agreement, it being 
\par understood that any and all rights of you to use such copies would have terminated upon 
\par such termination of such license; 
\par 
\par (ii) 
\par you shall provide NI with the Activity Compliance Logs and Usage Logs referenced within thirty 
\par (30) days of the effective date of such expiration or termination of the EP Term; and 
\par (iii) you shall immediately pay to NI all amounts not paid as of the effective date of expiration or 
\par termination of the EP Term. 
\par IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO OBTAIN ANY NECESSARY LICENSE FILES FROM NI TO ENABLE ANY 
\par PERMITTED POST-EP TERM USE OF ANY COPIES OF EP PRE-EXISTING SOFTWARE WHICH ARE 
\par DESIGNATED IN THE EP DOCUMENTATION FOR POST-EP TERM USE, AND TO INSTALL AND USE THE 
\par LICENSE FILE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER DELIVERY OF SUCH LICENSE FILE FROM NI, BUT IN NO 
\par EVENT LATER THAN SIXTY (60) DAYS AFTER THE TERMINATION OF THE EP TERM. THE SOFTWARE 
\par AND THE APPROVED VOLUME LICENSE MANAGERS MAY CONTAIN CODE THAT WILL, FOLLOWING 
\par TERMINATION OF THE EP TERM, DEACTIVATE YOUR ABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE UNDER THE EP. 
\par ALTHOUGH THE NI VLM MIGHT ATTEMPT TO WARN YOU OF THE TIME-FRAME IN WHICH YOUR 
\par ABILITY TO ACCESS AND USE THE SOFTWARE WILL BE DISABLED, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND 
\par AGREE THAT THE SOFTWARE MAY BE AUTOMATICALLY DEACTIVATED OR RENDERED UNUSABLE 
\par WITH OR WITHOUT WARNING UPON THE TERMINATION OF THE EP. 
\par 
\par (4.) EP Fees. The fees that will be charged to you in connection with the EP are set forth in the EP 
\par Documentation. Unless specified otherwise in the EP Documentation, all annual amounts due for the 
\par EP shall be paid by you to NI, or to the NI affiliate entering into the EP Documentation with you, within 
\par thirty (30) days of the date of each applicable invoice. All sums not paid when due shall accrue interest 
\par at the lesser of a monthly rate of 1.5% or the highest rate permissible by law on the unpaid balance until 
\par paid in full. Unless set forth otherwise in the EP Documentation, all amounts to be paid by you under the 
\par EP shall be in U.S. dollars. All fees quoted do not include applicable taxes or import/export duties. All 
\par sales, use, transient occupancy, and excise taxes and all import, export, or other duties relating to any 
\par deliverables provided by NI under the EP shall be your responsibility and be borne by you. All foreign, 
\par federal, state, and local taxes, however, based upon or measured by NI's net income, property, or net 
\par worth shall be the responsibility of and be borne by NI. If you directly or indirectly acquire a company or 
\par business that that has 20 or more current NI software licenses, then the fees that may be charged to 
\par you in connection with the EP will be increased. 
\par 
\par (5.) Confidentiality. The terms of your EP Documentation, and any proposals or other documents submitted 
\par by NI, or an authorized NI affiliate, (including all pricing and fees) in connection with your EP, and any

\par of the Term. However, if you have not acquired a perpetual license, subject to NI\rquote s acceptance, you may 
\par continue the Term for an additional period by remitting the then-current applicable license fee to NI. You 
\par hereby acknowledge and agree that the SOFTWARE may stop working and become unusable unless you 
\par pay the license fee and, if applicable, are provided with new authorization codes. Any use of the 
\par SOFTWARE after the Term expires will violate the terms of this Agreement. If you have purchased Software 
\par Service, you understand and agree that the support for the SOFTWARE will only continue for the amount of 
\par time specified in your purchase order for Software Service. After such time, you may continue to purchase 
\par Software Service at NI's then current price, provided that Software Service is offered.

\par compliance with, or making use of, the H.264/AVC visual standard or the VC-1 video standard; (vii) take any 
\par action that results in any of the SOFTWARE being subject to an Excluded License; or (viii) directly or indirectly, 
\par export, re-export, download, transmit, or ship the SOFTWARE in violation of Section 21.D. or otherwise in 
\par violation of any applicable laws or regulations, including those of the U.S., the European Union or the jurisdiction 
\par in which you use or are downloading the SOFTWARE. Further, all uses of the SOFTWARE shall be in 
\par accordance with the applicable documentation that accompanies the SOFTWARE and not in any manner 
\par intended to (or that) circumvents such documentation or the intent of this Agreement. Except as expressly 
\par permitted in Section 2, under no circumstance is "floating," shared, or concurrent use permitted under this

\par content or properly licensed content. You may require a patent, copyright, or other license from a third party to 
\par create, copy, download, record or save content files for use with this SOFTWARE or to serve or distribute such 
\par files to be used with the SOFTWARE. You agree that you shall only use the SOFTWARE and documentation in 
\par a manner that complies with all applicable laws in the jurisdictions in which you use the SOFTWARE and 
\par documentation, including applicable restrictions concerning copyright and other intellectual property rights. You 
\par may not use the SOFTWARE in an attempt to, or in conjunction with, any device, program or service designed to, 
\par circumvent technological measures employed to control access to, or the rights in, a content file or other work 
\par protected by the copyright laws of any jurisdiction. 
\par 
\par 5. 
\par Transfer. If you have a named user license, computer based license, debug license, or if the SOFTWARE is 
\par Multiple Access Software, you may transfer the SOFTWARE to a third party provided that you notify NI in writing 
\par of such transfer (including the name and location of such third party), such third party accepts the terms and 
\par conditions of this Agreement, and after such transfer, you do not retain any copies of the SOFTWARE (including 
\par all Upgrades that you may have received) nor retain any of the written materials accompanying the SOFTWARE. 
\par NI may, in its discretion, charge you a fee for the transfer of the SOFTWARE. If you have a VLP License, a 
\par Surviving VLP License, a concurrent use license, an academic license (including a student edition license), a 
\par Measurement Studio compile-only, or a debug license, the license is non-transferable and you may not, without 
\par the prior written consent of NI or its affiliates, distribute or otherwise provide the SOFTWARE to any third party or 
\par (with respect to a VLP License or a Surviving VLP License) to any of your sites or facilities not expressly 
\par identified in the applicable documents from NI. If you have any licenses under the EP, such licenses are 
\par non-transferable and you may not, without the prior written consent of NI or an authorized NI Affiliate distribute or 
\par otherwise provide the SOFTWARE to any third party or to any of your sites or facilities other than an EP 
\par Location. 
\par 6.

\par SOFTWARE (the "Pre-existing License") and (ii) the Upgrade was provided to you in accordance with the 
\par Limited Warranty noted below in Section 13 or provided to you as part of the Software Service for which you 
\par have paid applicable fees. The license agreement accompanying the Upgrade (the "Upgrade License") applies to 
\par your use of the Upgrade; provided, however, (i) you may only install and use the Upgrade on those computers on 
\par which you are authorized to use the pre-existing SOFTWARE pursuant to the Pre-existing License and (ii) in no 
\par event may you run both the Upgrade and the pre-existing SOFTWARE concurrently. Further and with respect to 
\par any SOFTWARE delivered and licensed under this Agreement ("Delivered SOFTWARE"), you may elect to 
\par install and use a pre-existing version of the applicable SOFTWARE (rather than the Delivered SOFTWARE); 
\par provided, (i) you have an authorized copy of the pre-existing version of the Delivered SOFTWARE, (ii) all use will 
\par be pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement (including the license type acquired for the Delivered 
\par SOFTWARE), and (iii) that notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall NI be 
\par required to support any versions of the SOFTWARE (including providing applicable software key codes or 
\par hardware keys) other than the then most current version of the Delivered SOFTWARE. 
\par 
\par 
\par 7. 
\par Home Usage Exception. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if you are a business or 
\par other entity, the designated Named User for the applicable license (or in the case of computer based licenses, 
\par the single individual who is the primary user of the single computer on which the SOFTWARE is installed and 
\par used, or in the case of Academic Licenses the teachers, professors or researchers) may also install and use the 
\par SOFTWARE on one (1) computer located in such user's home, provided that (i) the use of the SOFTWARE is 
\par pursuant to one of the licenses enumerated in Section 2 above (other than a Designated Deployment License, 
\par Measurement Studio compile-only license, debug license, concurrent use license, or concurrent use debug 
\par license); and (ii) the use of the SOFTWARE on such home computer is limited to work performed in the scope of 
\par such person's employment with you (or, in case of an Academic License, limited to the uses expressly permitted 
\par in such applicable section) and complies with all terms and conditions of this Agreement other than as expressly 
\par set forth in this Section. The SOFTWARE must be promptly uninstalled from the individual\rquote s home computer 
\par upon the earlier of (a) the termination of the designated individual\rquote s employment with you, (b) the transfer of the 
\par SOFTWARE to another Named User or change to another computer as permitted under Section 2 above, (c) the 
\par termination or expiration of this Agreement, or (d), in the case of Academic Licenses, the teacher, professor or 
\par researcher ceasing to be employed by the Academic Institution (whichever is earlier). Notwithstanding the 
\par foregoing, if you have a Designated Deployment License, Measurement Studio compile-only license, debug 
\par license, concurrent use license, or concurrent use debug license, this Home Usage Exception does not apply to 
\par you. 
\par 8. 
\par Multiple Versions (CD-ROM/DVD-ROM Media). If the SOFTWARE is distributed on a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM 
\par containing multiple versions of the SOFTWARE for use with different operating systems, you may only use one 
\par version of the SOFTWARE. The foregoing limitation does not apply to Multiple Access Software. 
\par 9. 
\par Software/Hardware Key. If the SOFTWARE requires a software key code or a hardware key, you acknowledge 
\par that the SOFTWARE will not function without a certain, unique software key code or hardware key. This software 
\par key code or hardware key will be furnished to you by NI and you agree that such software key code and 
\par hardware key is to be used solely with the SOFTWARE for which it is provided. While NI may (in its sole 
\par discretion) provide you with the applicable key prior to receipt from you of the applicable license fees, you will 
\par remain obligated to pay such fees to NI. 
\par 10. Copyright; No Other Licenses. The SOFTWARE, and all copies of the SOFTWARE, are owned by NI or its 
\par suppliers and are protected by applicable copyright laws and international treaty provisions. The SOFTWARE, 
\par and copies thereof, are licensed only, and are not sold or leased. Therefore, you must treat the SOFTWARE like 
\par any other copyrighted material. You may, however, (i) make a reasonable number of copies of the SOFTWARE 
\par solely for backup or archival purposes and (ii) make a reasonable number of copies of the documentation that 
\par accompanies the SOFTWARE solely for your internal use in connection with your use of the SOFTWARE. In no 
\par event may you remove or alter any copyright, patent, trademark, or other legal notices or disclaimers that exist in 
\par the SOFTWARE. All rights not expressly granted to you in this Agreement are reserved to NI. Further, and 
\par without limiting the foregoing, no license or any right of any kind (whether by express license, implied license, the 
\par doctrine of exhaustion, or otherwise) is granted under any NI patents (whether identified herein or not) or other 
\par intellectual property right of NI with respect to any other product(s) of NI or of any third party, including the right 
\par to use any of these other products. 
\par 11. Patent and Trademark Notice. 
\par For patents covering National Instruments products, refer to the appropriate 
\par location: Help\'bbPatents in the SOFTWARE, the patents.txt file on the CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, or ni.com/patents.

\par ni.com/trademarks for more information about National Instruments trademarks. Further, all other product and 
\par company names mentioned herein are (or may be) trademarks or trade names of their respective companies. 
\par 12. Application Deployment. You may distribute, deploy or otherwise make available Authorized Applications (along 
\par with applicable runtime engines for the SOFTWARE and applicable Driver Interface Software that you may 
\par include as part of or together with your Authorized Applications; and along with the Microsoft Silverlight software 
\par which may be provided by NI as Third Party Software if the Authorized Application is one created using such 
\par Microsoft Silverlight software) provided that you comply with each of the requirements set forth in sub-sections 
\par (A.) and (B.) below: 
\par A. 
\par Deployment and Distribution Requirements. 
\par 
\par 
\par (1.) You include the following copyright notice "Copyright \'a9 [insert year] National Instruments Corporation. 
\par All Rights Reserved." in the Authorized Application's About Box (if applicable) and in (i) any applicable 
\par written documentation or, (ii) if no such documentation exists, in a "read me" or other .txt file distributed 
\par with each copy of the Authorized Application; (you may instead, or in addition, include your own 
\par copyright notice with the notice(s) required above, but in no event may you remove or alter any 
\par copyright, patent, trademark, or other legal notices or disclaimers that exist in the SOFTWARE; and, 
\par with respect to any runtime engines for the SOFTWARE and any Driver Interface Software that you may 
\par include as part of or together with your Authorized Application, your copyright notice shall be 
\par understood as protecting NI\rquote s copyrights in the SOFTWARE and shall not be understood as meaning 
\par that you have any copyright in or with respect to any SOFTWARE); 
\par 
\par (2.) You do not use NI's name, logo, or trademarks to market your Authorized Application without NI's 
\par express prior written permission; 
\par 
\par (3.) You shall indemnify, hold harmless, and defend NI from and against any and all claims, demands, 
\par lawsuits, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees, that arise or result 
\par from the use or distribution of your Authorized Application, AND EVEN IF DUE IN PART TO NI'S 
\par CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER FAULT OR STRICT LIABILITY WITHOUT REGARD TO 
\par FAULT; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT YOUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION OF 
\par INDEMNIFICATION SHALL NOT EXTEND TO THE PERCENTAGE OF THE CLAIMANT'S 
\par DAMAGES OR INJURIES OR THE SETTLEMENT AMOUNT ATTRIBUTABLE TO NI'S 
\par NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER FAULT OR TO STRICT LIABILITY IMPOSED UPON NI AS A MATTER 
\par OF LAW; 
\par 
\par (4.) You conform to all of the requirements of the Third Party Software license agreements provided with the 
\par SOFTWARE, including complying with any provisions in the Third Party Software licenses regarding 
\par copyright notices; 
\par 
\par (5.) The Authorized Application is not and will not consist of or include any malicious, deceptive, or unlawful 
\par programs; and 
\par 
\par (6.) a. 
\par If you distribute to any third parties your Authorized Application with any run-time engine for the 
\par SOFTWARE or Driver Interface Software, you either pass through to your end users this 
\par Agreement, or license the Authorized Application and any run-time engine for the SOFTWARE and 
\par Driver Interface Software distributed with the Authorized Application, subject to your own license 
\par agreement that is substantially in accordance with this Agreement and with at least the following 
\par provisions: (i) a disclaimer of implied warranties and consequential damages in favor of you and 
\par your licensors; (ii) a restricted rights provision substantially similar to the Section of this Agreement 
\par entitled "U.S. Government Rights"; and (iii) restrictions against (a) reverse engineering, 
\par decompiling, or disassembling the SOFTWARE (except to the extent such foregoing restriction is 
\par expressly prohibited by applicable law); (b) sub-licensing, leasing, lending or renting the 
\par SOFTWARE; (c) distributing in whole or in part, modifying, or creating derivatives of the 
\par SOFTWARE; (d) using any H.264/MPEG-4 AVC and/or VC-1 technology or codecs included in or 
\par with Microsoft Silverlight software which may be provided by NI as Third Party Software, including 
\par for the purpose of encoding or decoding video in compliance with, or making use of, the H.264/AVC 
\par visual standard or the VC-1 video standard; (e) taking any action that results in any SOFTWARE 
\par being subject to an Excluded License; (f) directly or indirectly, exporting, re-exporting, downloading, 
\par transmitting or shipping the SOFTWARE in violation of Section 21.D. or otherwise in violation of 
\par any applicable laws or regulations, including those of the U.S., the European Union or the 
\par jurisdiction in which the SOFTWARE is used or downloaded; and (g) (if your Authorized Application 
\par enables the use of Scripting) using the Scripting functionality to create applications which perform 
\par the functionality of an editor for a graphical programming environment; and 
\par 
\par b. 
\par If you distribute to any third parties your Authorized Application with Microsoft Silverlight software 
\par which may be provided by NI as Third Party Software, then, in addition to complying with the other 
\par requirements of this Section 12. A. (6.), 
\par (i) you use the installer builder tool provided by NI with the SOFTWARE to create an installer for 
\par 
\par 
\par your Authorized Application and you include the installer that NI provides for the Microsoft 
\par Silverlight software in the installer for your Authorized Application, or you distribute your 
\par Authorized Application with the installer that NI provides at the following URL: 
\par http://digital.ni.com/express.nsf/bycode/InstallerForMicrosoftSilverlight, and, in either case, 
\par you do not modify the installer that NI provides or the installer experience (including display of 
\par the Microsoft Silverlight End User License Agreement and Privacy Statement); 
\par 
\par (ii) 
\par you provide the "Notice About the H.264/AVC Visual Standard and The VC-1 Video Standard" 
\par found in the Third Party Software license agreement for the Microsoft Silverlight software to 
\par such third parties, and ensure that such Notice is provided to others who may receive a copy 
\par of your Authorized Application with the Microsoft Silverlight software (such notice 
\par automatically being installed via the installer that NI provides for the Microsoft Silverlight 
\par software as described in Section 12. A. (6.) b. (i)); and 
\par (iii) 
\par after 30 days of being notified by NI of a Critical Update to the Microsoft Silverlight software, 
\par any new version of your Authorized Application must contain the updated version of the 
\par Microsoft Silverlight software. 
\par B. 
\par Fees. Generally, you may distribute, deploy or otherwise make available Authorized Applications without 
\par paying additional fees to NI. If, however, the Authorized Application was created utilizing any of the 
\par SOFTWARE identified in NI's Deployment Licenses listing web page, which web page is currently located at 
\par the following URL, or any SOFTWARE added by NI at any time to such listing or any similar successor 
\par listings: http://zone.ni.com/devzone/cda/tut/p/id/9561, or such other SOFTWARE as NI may from time to 
\par time designate, then you must (before distributing, deploying or otherwise making available the Authorized 
\par Application for use on any other computer) either: (i) verify that the recipient has a valid license to run the 
\par applicable Authorized Application on (or has a valid license for such SOFTWARE for) each computer on 
\par which the Authorized Application will be used; or (ii) obtain written distribution authorization from NI and (if 
\par required by NI) pay to NI a per copy distribution/development fee for each Authorized Application distributed, 
\par deployed or otherwise made available. In the case of any Driver Interface Software identified as being 
\par subject to the license verification or distribution authorization requirements stated above, if the Authorized 
\par Application utilizes, calls, or otherwise accesses any such Driver Interface Software, the Authorized 
\par Application shall be deemed to have been created utilizing such Driver Interface Software for purposes of 
\par this Section 12.B. 
\par 13. Limited Warranty. Except for SOFTWARE provided under an evaluation license which SOFTWARE is provided 
\par without warranty, NI warrants, for your benefit alone, that for a period of ninety (90) days from the date the 
\par SOFTWARE is shipped to you (or, if downloaded, from the date the SOFTWARE is first downloaded by you) (i) 
\par the SOFTWARE will perform substantially in accordance with the accompanying documentation, and (ii) the 
\par medium on which the SOFTWARE is recorded will be free from defects in materials and workmanship under 
\par normal use and service ("Limited Warranty"). Any replacement SOFTWARE will be warranted for the remainder 
\par of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow 
\par limitations on duration of an express or implied warranty, so the above or any other limitation provided herein 
\par may not apply to you. In such event, such warranties are limited to the minimum warranty period allowed by 
\par applicable law. You must obtain a Return Material Authorization number from NI before returning the 
\par SOFTWARE under warranty to NI and you agree to pay expenses for shipment to and from NI. The Limited 
\par Warranty is void if failure of the SOFTWARE has resulted from accident, abuse, misapplication, improper 
\par calibration by you, third party products (i.e., hardware or software) used by you which are not intended by NI for 
\par use with the SOFTWARE, utilization of an improper hardware or software key (if applicable), or unauthorized 
\par maintenance of the SOFTWARE. 
\par 14. 
\par Customer Remedies. NI's sole obligation (and your sole remedy) with respect to the foregoing Limited Warranty 
\par shall be to, at NI's option, return the fees paid by you to NI, in which event you must return or destroy all copies 
\par of the SOFTWARE in accordance with NI's reasonable instructions, in which case the license granted to you 
\par shall terminate without liability on the part of NI by reason of such termination, or repair or replace the 
\par SOFTWARE, provided that NI receives written notice of applicable defects during the warranty period. You 
\par hereby agree not to bring an action to enforce your remedies under the foregoing Limited Warranty, or for breach 
\par of warranty, more than one (1) year after the accrual of such cause of action. 
\par 
\par 
\par 15. 
\par No Other Warranties. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH ABOVE, NO WARRANTIES, EITHER 
\par EXPRESS OR IMPLIED ARE MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE OR 
\par SOFTWARE SERVICES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR 
\par A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. THERE ARE NO OTHER WARRANTIES THAT MAY 
\par ARISE FROM USAGE OF TRADE OR COURSE OF DEALING. NI DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL IMPLIED 
\par WARRANTIES, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
\par PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE, THIRD PARTY 
\par SOFTWARE, AND THE SOFTWARE SERVICES. NI DOES NOT WARRANT, GUARANTEE, OR MAKE ANY 
\par REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OF OR THE RESULTS OF THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR 
\par SOFTWARE SERVICES IN TERMS OF CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE AND 
\par DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE OR SOFTWARE SERVICES WILL BE 
\par UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE. 
\par 16. Intellectual Property Liability. NI shall, at its own expense, defend any claim brought against you by a third party 
\par resulting from your use of the SOFTWARE as authorized by your license, to the extent that such claim alleges 
\par that the SOFTWARE infringes any patent, copyright, or trademark of such third party protected by the laws of the 
\par U.S.A., Canada, Mexico, Japan, Australia, Switzerland, Norway, or the European Union, provided that such 
\par claim does not arise from your use of the SOFTWARE in combination with equipment, devices, software or code 
\par not made by NI, or from any modification of the SOFTWARE not made by NI, and further provided that you notify 
\par NI in writing immediately upon your obtaining notice of such impending claim and that you fully cooperate with NI 
\par in preparing a defense. If you provide to NI the authority, assistance, and information NI needs to defend or settle 
\par such claim, NI shall pay any final award of damages or settlement with respect to such claim and any expense 
\par you incur at NI's written request, but NI shall not be liable for a settlement made without its prior written consent. 
\par If the SOFTWARE is held to be infringing of the rights stated above and the use thereof is enjoined NI shall, or if 
\par NI believes the SOFTWARE may be held to infringe a third party's intellectual property rights NI may, at its option, 
\par either (i) procure for you the right to use the SOFTWARE; (ii) replace or modify the SOFTWARE with other 
\par software which does not infringe; or (iii) receive your return of the infringing SOFTWARE and refund to you the 
\par license fee payment(s) made by you to NI for the SOFTWARE. NI'S LIABILITY UNDER THIS SECTION 16, 
\par (INCLUDING THAT OF ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS AND ITS AND THEIR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, 
\par EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS, AND REGARDLESS OF THE REASON FOR SUCH LIABILITY) SHALL IN NO 
\par EVENT EXCEED IN THE AGGREGATE $50,000 (U.S.), AND IN NO EVENT SHALL NI BE OBLIGATED 
\par UNDER THIS SECTION 16 TO INCUR OR PAY, IN THE AGGREGATE, ANY AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE 
\par AMOUNT SET FORTH IN THIS SENTENCE. The foregoing states your sole remedy for, and NI's entire liability 
\par and responsibility for, infringement of any patent, trademark, copyright, or other intellectual or industrial property 
\par right relating to the SOFTWARE. THIS LIMITED INDEMNITY IS IN LIEU OF ANY OTHER STATUTORY OR 
\par IMPLIED WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT. THE FOREGOING OBLIGATIONS SHALL NOT APPLY 
\par TO ANY THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS INCORPORATED IN OR 
\par OTHERWISE PROVIDED WITH THE SOFTWARE, AND YOU AGREE TO LOOK TO THE APPLICABLE 
\par THIRD PARTY MANUFACTURER WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIMS FOR INFRINGEMENT INVOLVING 
\par THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE OR THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS. 
\par 17. Limitation On Liability. The entire liability of NI and its licensors, distributors, and suppliers (including its and their 
\par directors, officers, employees, and agents) is set forth above. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
\par APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL NI AND ITS LICENSORS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND SUPPLIERS 
\par (INCLUDING ITS AND THEIR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS) BE LIABLE FOR ANY 
\par INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY 
\par KIND; ANY EXPENSES, LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR LOST 
\par BUSINESS INFORMATION; OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, EXCEPT DIRECT DAMAGES NOT EXCEEDING IN 
\par THE AGGREGATE THE LICENSE FEE PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT INVOLVED; ARISING OUT 
\par OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, ANY TECHNICAL 
\par SUPPORT SERVICES RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE OR THE THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, OR RELATED 
\par HARDWARE, EVEN IF NI OR ITS LICENSORS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND SUPPLIERS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF 
\par THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES; AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED 
\par TO BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF NI OR OTHERS. You acknowledge that the applicable fees and prices reflect 
\par this allocation of risk. Because some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for 
\par consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply. If the foregoing limitation of liability is 
\par not enforceable because the SOFTWARE, the Third Party Software, the services, or the hardware is determined 
\par by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment to be defective and to have directly 
\par caused bodily injury, death, or property damage, in no event shall the aggregate liability of NI, its licensors, 
\par distributors, and suppliers for property damage exceed the greater of $50,000 (U.S.) or the license fee paid for 
\par the SOFTWARE. 
\par 
\par 
\par 18. 
\par Warning. (1) NI PRODUCTS ARE NOT DESIGNED WITH COMPONENTS AND TESTING FOR A LEVEL OF 
\par RELIABILITY SUITABLE FOR USE IN OR IN CONNECTION WITH SURGICAL IMPLANTS OR AS CRITICAL 
\par COMPONENTS IN ANY LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS WHOSE FAILURE TO PERFORM CAN REASONABLY 
\par BE EXPECTED TO CAUSE SIGNIFICANT INJURY TO A HUMAN. (2) IN ANY APPLICATION, INCLUDING 
\par THE ABOVE, RELIABILITY OF OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS CAN BE IMPAIRED BY 
\par ADVERSE FACTORS, INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN ELECTRICAL POWER SUPPLY, COMPUTER 
\par HARDWARE MALFUNCTIONS, COMPUTER OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE FITNESS, FITNESS OF 
\par COMPILERS AND DEVELOPMENT SOFTWARE USED TO DEVELOP AN APPLICATION, INSTALLATION 
\par ERRORS, SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY PROBLEMS, MALFUNCTIONS OR FAILURES 
\par OF ELECTRONIC MONITORING OR CONTROL DEVICES, TRANSIENT FAILURES OF ELECTRONIC 
\par SYSTEMS (HARDWARE AND/OR SOFTWARE), UNANTICIPATED USES OR MISUSES, OR ERRORS ON 
\par THE PART OF THE USER OR APPLICATIONS DESIGNER (ADVERSE FACTORS SUCH AS THESE ARE 
\par HEREAFTER COLLECTIVELY TERMED "SYSTEM FAILURES"). ANY APPLICATION WHERE A SYSTEM 
\par FAILURE WOULD CREATE A RISK OF HARM TO PROPERTY OR PERSONS (INCLUDING THE RISK OF 
\par BODILY INJURY AND DEATH) SHOULD NOT BE RELIANT SOLELY UPON ONE FORM OF ELECTRONIC 
\par SYSTEM DUE TO THE RISK OF SYSTEM FAILURE. TO AVOID DAMAGE, INJURY, OR DEATH, THE USER 
\par OR APPLICATION DESIGNER MUST TAKE REASONABLY PRUDENT STEPS TO PROTECT AGAINST 
\par SYSTEM FAILURES, INCLUDING BACK-UP OR SHUT DOWN MECHANISMS. BECAUSE EACH END-USER 
\par SYSTEM IS CUSTOMIZED AND DIFFERS FROM NI'S TESTING PLATFORMS AND BECAUSE A USER OR 
\par APPLICATION DESIGNER MAY USE NI PRODUCTS IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER PRODUCTS IN A 
\par MANNER NOT EVALUATED OR CONTEMPLATED BY NI, THE USER OR APPLICATION DESIGNER IS 
\par ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR VERIFYING AND VALIDATING THE SUITABILITY OF NI PRODUCTS 
\par WHENEVER NI PRODUCTS ARE INCORPORATED IN A SYSTEM OR APPLICATION, INCLUDING THE 
\par APPROPRIATE DESIGN, PROCESS, AND SAFETY LEVEL OF SUCH SYSTEM OR APPLICATION. 
\par 19. U.S. Government Rights. The SOFTWARE is a "commercial item" developed exclusively at private expense, 
\par consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation" as such 
\par terms are defined or used in the applicable U.S. acquisition regulations. If you are an agency, department, or 
\par other entity of the United States Government, the SOFTWARE is licensed hereunder (i) only as a commercial 
\par item and (ii) with only those rights as are granted to all other licensees pursuant to the terms and conditions of 
\par this Agreement. You agree not to use, duplicate, or disclose the SOFTWARE in any way not expressly permitted 
\par by this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement requires NI to produce or furnish technical data for or to you. 
\par 20. Compliance. 
\par A. 
\par You agree to make all applicable records available for review by NI during your normal business hours so as 
\par to permit NI (upon reasonable notice to you) to verify your compliance with the terms and conditions of this 
\par Agreement. Further, if you are a business or other entity, you agree that upon the request of NI or NI's 
\par authorized representative, you will promptly document and certify in writing to NI that your and your 
\par employees' 
\par use of the SOFTWARE complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. NI may (upon 
\par written notice) inspect your use of the SOFTWARE during your normal business hours to ensure your 
\par compliance with this Agreement. If the results of any such inspection indicate the underpayment by you of 
\par applicable fees due and payable to NI, you shall (i) immediately pay such amounts to NI; and (ii) reimburse 
\par NI for the cost of such inspection. 
\par B. 
\par You agree that the SOFTWARE may collect and communicate certain software, hardware, and use 
\par information to NI\rquote s (or its service providers') servers for the purposes of (i) checking for and performing any 
\par updates, (ii) ensuring that you have complied and are complying with the terms and license conditions in this 
\par Agreement, including your use of valid software key codes or hardware keys or both, and (iii) NI's internal 
\par product development. The information collected and communicated does not include any proprietary 
\par application data. NI will not provide any of the information to any third party except as required (i) by law or 
\par legal process, or (ii) to enforce compliance with the terms and license conditions in this Agreement, including 
\par your use of valid software key codes or hardware keys or both. 
\par 21. General. 
\par A. 
\par If the SOFTWARE is manufactured in the Republic of Ireland, (1) (i) this Agreement is governed by the laws 
\par of the Republic of Ireland, exclusive of any provisions of the United Nations Convention on the International 
\par 
\par 
\par Sale of Goods, and without regard to principles of conflicts of law; and (ii) the non-exclusive venue for all 
\par actions under this Agreement shall be in the courts located in Dublin, the Republic of Ireland and the parties 
\par agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts; otherwise (2) (i) this Agreement is governed by the laws of 
\par the State of Texas, U.S.A., exclusive of any provisions of the United Nations Convention on the International 
\par Sale of Goods, and without regard to principles of conflicts of law; and (ii) the non-exclusive venue for all 
\par actions under this Agreement shall be in the courts located in Travis County, Texas, U.S.A. and the parties 
\par agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts. 
\par 
\par B. This Agreement (and if applicable the VLP Documentation and the EP Documentation) constitutes the 
\par complete agreement between you and NI regarding the SOFTWARE and supersedes any oral or written 
\par proposals, prior agreements, purchase orders, or any other communication between you and NI relating to 
\par the subject matter of this Agreement. If there is a conflict between the terms and conditions of this National 
\par Instruments Software License Agreement and any applicable Specific Product Addendum, the terms and 
\par conditions of the Specific Product Addendum shall prevail and control with respect to the SOFTWARE 
\par product(s) to which the Specific Product Addendum applies. If there is a conflict between the terms and 
\par conditions of this Agreement and the VLP Documentation or the EP Documentation, the terms and 
\par conditions of this Agreement shall prevail and control. NI's applicable standard Terms and Conditions of Sale, 
\par the current version of which is set forth at http://www.ni.com/legal/termsofsale, shall apply as applicable with 
\par respect to any technical support services provided as part of the Software Services, and to any Training & 
\par Certification Services provided under an EP, provided, however that in any event the provisions of this 
\par Agreement shall apply and control with respect to any Upgrades or other SOFTWARE which may be 
\par provided as part of or in connection with any such services. No delay or omission by NI to exercise any right 
\par or power it has under this Agreement shall impair or be construed as a waiver of such right or power. A 
\par waiver by NI of any breach of any provision hereof shall not be construed to be a waiver of any succeeding 
\par breach of that provision or of any breach of any other provision. No modification of this Agreement shall be 
\par effective unless set forth in a writing signed by a duly authorized representative of you and NI. The word 
\par "including" as used in this Agreement shall be understood as meaning "including without limitation". If you 
\par are unable to access the internet to view any of the web pages referred to in this Agreement, you may 
\par request the information from your local NI sales office. 
\par C. 
\par If any action is brought by either party to this Agreement against the other regarding the subject matter 
\par hereof, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover, in addition to any relief granted, reasonable attorney 
\par fees and court costs. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, the offending clause will be modified 
\par so as to be enforceable and, as modified, shall be fully enforced, and the remainder of this Agreement will 
\par continue in full force and effect. 
\par D. 
\par The SOFTWARE is, and Third Party Software provided by NI with the SOFTWARE may be, subject to 
\par control under the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (15 CFR Part 730 et. seq.), other applicable U.S. 
\par export control laws and regulations, and applicable global export control laws and regulations, including, for 
\par products exported from the European Union, the Council Regulation (EC) No. 428/2009 (the "Regulation") 
\par and the Hungarian Government Decree No. 50/2004 (III. 23.). You agree that you will not export, re-export 
\par or transfer any SOFTWARE or Third Party Software provided by NI with the SOFTWARE via any means to 
\par any prohibited destination, entity or individual without the required export license(s) or authorization(s) from 
\par the U.S. Government and/or other applicable export licensing authority. NI reserves the right not to ship or 
\par permit downloading of the SOFTWARE ordered if, at any time, NI believes that such shipment or 
\par downloading of such SOFTWARE or any Third Party Software provided by NI with such SOFTWARE, may 
\par violate U.S. and/or other applicable export control laws. If you are downloading the SOFTWARE, you hereby 
\par represent and warrant to NI as follows: (i) you are not located in, or under the control of, any country the 
\par laws and regulations of which prohibit importation of the SOFTWARE or any Third Party Software provided 
\par by NI with the SOFTWARE; and (ii) you are not located in, or under the control of, any country to which the 
\par laws and regulations of the U.S. and/or other applicable export control laws prohibit exportation of the 
\par SOFTWARE or any such Third Party Software. For text of the relevant legal materials, see
